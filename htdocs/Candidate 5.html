<p>Senate President Vicente Sotto III said his running mate Sen. Panfilo “Ping” Lacson easily proved his worth to be the country’s next president during last weekend’s presidential interview with television anchor Jessica Soho.
Sotto, who is running as vice president alongside Lacson, commended his colleague for his “outstanding performance” during the interview, which was attended by three other public officials gunning for the presidency in this year’s national elections. (INQUIRER)</p>

<h1>Stands on various issues</h1>
<section>
<p>WEST PHILIPPINE SEA: Lacson was one of the senators who supported Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana in demanding that Chinese military leave Julian Felipe Reef (Whitsun Reef) in the West Philippine Sea. “Filipinos should stand foursquare behind DND Secretary Delfin Lorenzana for making known his strong position in defending our country’s sovereign rights over the Whitsun Reef (Julian Felipe Reef) – and, before that, the Mischief Reef, occupied by the Chinese during the period 1994 to 1995 and the Scarborough Shoal, which China cordoned off in 2012,” Lacson said on April 5, 2021.(RAPPLER)</p>
<p>SOCIAL INEQUALITY: “Kapag kakampi, libre; kapag kalaban, tutuluyan. Hindi ka magsu-succeed kapag double standard ka,” Lacson told Rappler on August 11, 2021. (If you’re their ally, you walk free; if you’re an enemy, they’ll go all the way. You will not succeed if you have double standards.) He was commenting on Duterte’s war on drugs and why it failed.(RAPPLER)</p>
<p>
DEATH PENALTY:  Presidential aspirant Senator Panfilo “Ping Lacson” on Saturday defended changing his stance on death penalty, saying there’s nothing wrong with changing one’s mind when one has been “awakened” with the truth.

Speaking on Jessica Soho’s Presidential Interviews aired on GMA-7, Lacson, who was once a staunch advocate for the reinstitution of capital punishment, previously said he changed his mind because of a movie “The Life of David Gale,” which was about a man who was on death row.(RAPPLER)

<h1>Issues and controversies</h1>
<section>
<p>During the Martial Law years, from 1971 to 1986, Lacson was part of the Metrocom Intelligence and Security Group (MISG). In Dark Legacy: Human rights under the Marcos regime, historian Alfred McCoy wrote that Lacson, together with MISG commander Colonel Rolando Abadilla and comrade Robert Ortega, “tortured [suspected subversives] together.” (RAPPLER)
</p>
<p>Lacson went into hiding in January 2010, after a local court issued a warrant for his arrest in relation to a the November 2000 murder of publicist Salvador Dacer and his driver Emmanuel Corbito. Lacson denied any involvement in the killings and blamed President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s administration for persecuting him. He came out of hiding in March 2011. In November of that year, the Supreme Court affirmed a Court of Appeals ruling to clear Lacson of the charges.(RAPPLER)</p>
<p>Murder charges were filed against Lacson and his men for shooting 11 members of the Kuratong Baleleng syndicate in an operation in 1995 criticized as a “rubout.” In 2003, Judge Theresa Yadao of Quezon City regional trial court dismissed the case against them for lack of probable cause. In 2013, the Supreme Court dismissed the murder case with finality. (RAPPLER)</p>
