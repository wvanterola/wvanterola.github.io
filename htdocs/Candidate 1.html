<h1>Qualifications</h1>
<section>
<p>Maria Leonor "Leni" Gerona Robredo is a Filipina lawyer, politician, and social activist who is the 14th and 
incumbent vice president of the Philippines. She served as the representative of Camarines Sur's 3rd district from 
2013 until her inauguration as vice president in 2016. In the vice presidential election, Robredo defeated Bongbong Marcos.</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Office of the Vice President (OVP) under Robredo provided free shuttle services 
for pandemic frontline workers, swab tests, telehealth services, and raised funds for relief operations across the country. 
Robredo is the second woman to serve as vice president of the Philippines after Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and the first vice 
president from Bicol Region. In 2016, Robredo was awarded by the Thai government for her work and advocacy in women empowerment 
and gender equality. Under her leadership, the OVP also received the ISO 9001: 2015 certification for the office's quality management systems.</p>
<p>On August 23, 2016, Robredo was awarded the Most Influential Filipina Woman of the World award by Filipina Women's Network (FWN), a non-government organization.</p>
<p>Three universities have conferred Robredo with honorary doctorates:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Polytechnic University of the Philippines (2015, Doctor in Public Administration)</li>
	<li>University of Saint Anthony in Iriga, Camarines Sur, her home province (2017, Doctor of Humanities)</li>
	<li>University of the Cordilleras (2017, Doctor of Laws)</li>

<h1>Stands on various issues</h1>
<section>
<p>While the Philippines may be considered one of the most gender equal countries in the world, Leni Robredo said much work 
still needed to be done to remove economic and social barriers that hinder Filipino women's empowerment.</p>
<p>Leni Robredo maintained her stance favoring same-sex unions in the Philippines but rejected the idea of 
decriminalizing abortion, saying local health services should instead be strengthened.</p>
<p>“I have always been very open about freedom of choice – ‘yung pagbigay ng kalayaan para sa lahat na i-pursue ‘yung gusto 
nila basta hindi ito makakasama sa kapwa niya,” Robredo said of same-sex civil unions.</p>
